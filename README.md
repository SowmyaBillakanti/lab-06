## Overview
This is an API server which will provide data to the City Explore Application. It allows a user to search for a specific location to get the weather, latitude, longitude of an area. This is only using data from API's that the server fetches and manages. 

## Getting Started
Created a method to get the path to Location and weather that results in showing the weather, latitude and longitude for the particular location that a user inputed.

## Architecture
- We are using JavaScript, 
- .json files for data, 
- API's from various locations.

## Change Log
